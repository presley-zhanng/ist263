        <p>
            I am Presley Zhang, I am currently an <strong>Applied Data Analytics</strong> major and I am not sure what kind of data I am interested in at the moment. I have a little coding experience with python, java, and a little of C++. Outside of school, I love playing games and talking to my friends from home.
